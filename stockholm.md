There are some great local tech events to learn and recruit at. The ones we've
been to and can recommend are:

  occasional other events

We haven't been to, but are hearing good things about:

* [Digilites](http://www.meetup.com/Digilites/), Sunday morning hacking
* [Sthlm Startups](http://www.meetup.com/Sthlm-Startups/), a meetup for
  startup junkies

# Stockholm

## Talking to the locals

Of all the countries in the world where people learn English as a second
language, Sweden is probably one of the best, in terms of how well people
actually speak it. Signs and menus everywhere are still all in Swedish
(sometimes English as well), so you'll probably need to ask for help now and
then.

You can safely assume that just about anyone between the ages of 20 and 70
is probably more or less fluent in English (though they're likely to deny it).
Of course, it's always polite to ask first to make sure, and that gives these
modest, self-effacing people a chance to say, "Yes, English is fine with me!" 

## Getting around

There's really comprehensive public transportation available, consisting of
subways, buses, commuter trains, and even a few boats, run by something called
SL. All together these things cover a huge amount of territory, probably a
50-mile radius around Stockholm. If you want to use this, you'll need to get an
SL card, which is a smart card that you can load up with cash to pay for
individual trips, or for a time-limited, unlimited usage kind of thing. Many
people who live here pay 790 SEK (about $90) per month for unlimited rides
during a 30-day period. There's also a 7-day card for 300 SEK, and shorter
periods too. If you're visiting for a week or less, it probably makes more sense
to get an SL card and pre-load it with some cash. A short subway ride costs 25
SEK, and if you're extending that go to more distant zones via bus or train, a
ride can cost from 25 to 50 SEK. If you run out of money on it, you can reload
it with more from your credit/debit card at every subway station.

Of course there's Uber and normal cabs here as well, but with such good public
transportation here it seldom seems worth it, at least for destinations within
the city.

Also, the inner section of the city is highly walkable. You can walk between the
central station and thoughtbot's office in 20 minutes or less, and wherever
you're staying for your visit is probably even closer than that. So depending on
what you're planning to do in the city, there's a good chance you can get by
just on foot.

## Paying for things:

Sweden is very nearly a cash-free country. Cards are the norm, and very often
payment is totally automated, which requires using a PIN code and a card with a
chip instead of just a magnetic stripe. So if your bank hasn't yet given you a
VISA/Mastercard with a chip yet, ask them to do so.  It will make things a lot
smoother since you won't have to sign to pay things (and some automated payment
terminals won't work with an old-style card at all). However, if you have a debit card without a chip,
you can still pay at restaurants, and almost everything will work fine.

Sweden is not a really tipping-heavy culture. Eating lunch at a restaurant,
you're never expected to leave a tip. At restaurants and bars, a 10% tip (which
is can almost be an insult in the US) is seen as a pretty generous tip. On the
downside, nearly everything is pretty expensive, so it all evens out.

## Cafes

transportation.

## Shopping

There's no end of things to buy in Stockholm. For many common items, there are
generally neighborhoods where you'll find more of that kind of thing. Whatever
you're looking for, your best bet is probably to ask around among people at the
Stockholm office for tips about where to find things.

Many small shops close at 5:00pm, but more and more of the larger ones are open
until 6 or 7.  Restaurants and bars are open until 11, 12, maybe later.

## Miscellaneous sights to see

*Gamla Stan*, the old town, is something that really sticks out for many people,
especially Americans, since we have almost nothing this old. This tiny island is
full of buildings whose foundations (and often the buildings themselves) are 300
years old, if not more. The island is covered with narrow roads that cars can
barely drive on (in fact, on many roads cards are only allowed for deliveries,
or not at all). It's all cobblestones and quaintness, and the royal palace
(which frankly looks sort of boxy and dull, considering what it is) is also
here. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, and pubs situated in ancient,
vaulted cellars, and it's all pretty great. It's also very touristy, especially
on Västerlånggatan ("western long street") which is the main shopping street in
Gamla Stan, and which also contains the Sci-Fi Bookstore, which some people
swear is the single best store in Stockholm.

The Vasa museum is worth a visit if you have an interest in history and a few
hours to spare. The Vasa was Sweden's naval flagship, built to extraordinary
specifications from the king, and it sank within a few minutes of its very first
launch. It stayed underwater for 333 years, when it was finally located again
and hauled up, and is now largely rebuilt and on display at the Vasa museum.
There are lots of interesting artifacts to see, and the story of this remarkable
engineering failure, due to unrealistic requirements and poor communication, is
still an important one today.

The big park area called Djurgården (where the Vasa museum and lots of other
things are) is a really nice place to walk around. Beautiful green spaces, and
some of central Stockholm's nicest homes can be found here.

Central Stockholm consists of several islands and waterways, and there are boat
tours that will take you around several of these with a guide pointing things
out, which can be a nice way to spend an hour or two and see a lot of Stockholm.

If you have even more time available to spend on boats, there are tons of places
to visit in the archipelago, which is just a massive cluster of hundreds of
small islands between Stockholm and the sea. This is all way more interesting in
summer than in winter, of course.

If you are here in winter though, especially during December, you might want to
check out some of the outdoor Christmas markets. You can find all sorts of
handcrafted items for sale, and plenty of local delicacies (cheese, sausage,
smoked meat, canned jams and honey, etc). And of course you can warm yourself
with some roasted almonds (*brända mandlar*) and/or some warm mulled wine
(*glögg*).

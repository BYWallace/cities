# Moving to USA from overseas

* Fill out Social Security Application and take to SSA
  * http://socialsecurity.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf
  * SSA office locations: http://ssaofficelocations.com/
* Open a bank account: you will need:
  * Your passport with visa in it
  * An employment letter from Anna outlining:
    - Your home address
    - Your office address
    - Your annual salary
* Get a secured credit card: in order to build up your credit rating.
  It basically operates like a debit card,
  which means you cannot spend more than you have.
  You will need your SSN for the application.

## Rentals options for new comers

* Sublet for a few months until your build up your credit rating,
  (while you wait for your stuff to arrive).
  AirBnB now has a [sublets](https://www.airbnb.com/sublets) search option.
* Find a private landlord that will agree to take you up as tenant.
  They usually will ask for 1 month rent, 1 month deposit and
  1 extra month for security since you probably don't have any credit rating.
* Have a guarantor that earns 80 times the monthly rent and
  has a good credit rating to co-sign the lease with you.
* If you find a place in a standardized rent building, you will need to either:
  - have that guarantor; or
  - use [Insurent](http://www.insurent.com)
